# Vanilla JS Drum Kit 

This is a simple web app that lets you play a drum kit using your keyboard. You can press the keys A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, and L to play different drum sounds. The app also shows the corresponding key on the screen when you press it.

## How to use it

To use this app, you need to have a web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. You can either download the source code from this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser, or you can visit the live demo [here].

## How it works

This app uses vanilla JavaScript to add event listeners to the keyboard keys and play the corresponding audio files. It also uses CSS transitions and animations to add some visual effects to the keys and the screen.

The app consists of three main files:

•  `index.html`: This file contains the basic structure of the app, including the title, the instructions, and the div elements for each key.

•  `style.css`: This file contains the styling rules for the app, such as the colors, fonts, sizes, positions, and animations of the elements.

•  `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code that adds functionality to the app, such as selecting the audio files, adding event listeners to the keys, playing the sounds, and toggling the classes for the animations.
